#### By _**Brenna Lavin**_

#### _This project is a Web Api application for an animal shelter_

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET
* Swagger
* MySQL Workbench
* Microsoft EntityFramework Core

## Description

_This project is an exploration in creating APIs while adding a variety of features like versioning, pagination and Swagger documentation_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* In order to use this application you must have MySQL Workbench installed. Depending on your machine please follow setup instructions listed [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql)
* Clone this repository to your local machine
* Navigate to the project's ```AnimalShelter``` folder.
* In the project's ```AnimalShelter``` folder, you will next need to create an appsettings.json file with the following information where YOURPASSWORDHERE is the password used to connect to MySQL:

```
  {
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=brenna_lavin;uid=root;pwd=[YOURPASSWORDHERE];"
  }
  }
  ```

* To install the project's dependencies, in the command line type ```dotnet restore```
* To ensure the database is properly connected to the project, type ```dotnet ef database update```, this will ideally apply the most recent migration of the database.
* Once in the Project folder, type ```dotnet run`` in the command line to run the program.

## API Documentation
You can explore the endpoints in Postman or in a browser!

### Using Swagger Documentation
To Explore the Animal Shelter Api with NSwag, after launching the project using ```dotnet run``` navigate to ```http://localhost:5004/swagger```
### Note on Pagination AND Versioning
Currently the pagination only works within version 1.0 of the api, to explore the pagination navigate to ```http://localhost:5004/api/1.0/animals in the browser.
Each page shows 5 entries, and will provide links to the first, last, previous and next page.
